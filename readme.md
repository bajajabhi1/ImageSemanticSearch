How to run the code:</b>
Put all of these files in /source/ folder of the matlab code.

<b>$ python webserver.py</b>
> ^instantiates server running on localhost:8080/upload
doing a post request to localhost:8080/upload will start the tagging and should return a wellformed JSON.
doing a get request opens up a simple GUI that should let you upload files and run the full code (for test purposes)
It's pretty iffy on my computer - the mexFile issues are very irritating.

This master branch is deprecated - all active development is on sourceversion - we should probably replace the 2.
